EventsBungee
=====
Updated version of the bukkit plugin: https://github.com/C4K3/Events

NOTE: In the bungee config make sure the main server is called Survival and the event server is called EventWorld.

Main changes:

/quitevent sends players back to the survival server. To go to the event server, you need this plugin: https://github.com/MoWobbler/ConnectToEvents

Removed some uneeded data

Plugin still needs to be polished up and tested
